# About Page

This is a webpage about me, Zoe, where you can find some information regarding my name, when I expect to graduate, if I currently have a web development job, and if I have had a job or internship doing web development. There are two images of me as well. There is a button at the bottom of the page to show the alert for the helloWorld function.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
```
This will install the necessary dependencies for the project.

Then start the live server to see the webpage. 

## Development

It is recommended to use the VSCode Live Server extension to run the project
locally. This will allow you to see changes in real-time as you make them. There
is no need to run a build process or refresh the page manually. Additionally,
you do not need to setup a local server to run the project.
